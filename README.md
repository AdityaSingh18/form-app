Structure of the Code
The Form App follows a structured architecture that adheres to the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern. Here's a breakdown of the code structure:

Install Dependencies: Ensure you have Node.js installed on your system. Clone the Form App repository and install dependencies using npm.

Set Up Environment Variables:

Create a .env file in the root directory of the project.
Define the following environment variables in the .env file:
makefile
Copy code
DB_NAME=<your_database_name>
DB_USERNAME=<your_database_username>
DB_PASSWORD=<your_database_password>
Start the Application: Run the Form App server using the command node app.js. The server will start running on port 3000.

Explore the API: Use an API testing tool like Postman to explore and interact with the Form App API endpoints.


Description: The main application file (app.js) sets up the Express server, connects to the database, and defines middleware.

2. Routes
Description: Routes are defined in separate files inside the routes directory. Each route file exports an Express router with specific route handlers.
